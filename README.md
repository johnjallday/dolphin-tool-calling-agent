This is a simple tool calling agent written in Go.
If you want something compiled, then this is a way to go.

```
```

## Usage
For Reaper users, I‚Äôve created simple tools that can read and launch your custom Lua scripts. 
Everyone has a different workflow, so I can‚Äôt provide a one-size-fits-all solution. 
However, if you are comfortable writing your own custom scripts, this tool might be very useful.

## Roadmap
-[] gRPC plugin setup for modularity
-[] GUI version using Fyne
-[] Agent Building UX
-[] Python Support
